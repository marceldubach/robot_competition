## Folder description

The main.py script is the main program that runs on the Raspberry Pi, while all others files contain functions that are imported and used in the main.py script. In particular, the localization.py script features all the functions required to retrieve the absolute pose of the robot from the beacon positions in the image. The kalmanFilter.py script contains the covariance matrices as well as the implementation of the Kalman filter. The utilities.py script defines the functions used to detect bottles in the image while the states.py file features all the states implemented in the main program state machine.
