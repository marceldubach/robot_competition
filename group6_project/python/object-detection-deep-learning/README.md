## Folder description

The deep_learning_object_detection.py is the script that feedforwards the blob from the image in the neural network and draws the output of the model. MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt is the Caffe prototxt file, while MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel is the pre-trained model. 
In the command-line.txt file you can find an example to test the performance of the object detector on a given image.
